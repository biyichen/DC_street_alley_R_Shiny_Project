# DC_street_alley_R_Shiny_Project
#### I looked at multiple questions to do descriptive analysis of the 311 Service Requests in the last 30 days for street and alley cleaning requests on public property in WASHINGTON DC dataset. I discussed the available variables and came up with the following questions:
#### 1.	What SERVICE CODE DESCRIPTION in where and at what status of investigations?
#### 2.	If there is INSPECTION FLAG exist and its locations and at what status of investigations?
#### I used the SERVICECODEDESCRIPTION, SERVICEORDERSTATUS, INSPECTIONFLAG, ZIPCODE, LATITUDE and LONGITUDE variables from the dataset. 
#### I found the data from DC OpenData. This data is available free of cost and can be found here (http://opendata.dc.gov/datasets/streetalley-cleaning-last-30-days )
#### DPW provides street cleaning to ensure clean and safe District streets and proper removal of litter and/or bulk items. Because there are some streets and alleys do not have the investigations before the cleaning, which might create not necessary extra work and cost if the streets and alleys already cleaned or not dirty. Also, DPW can find the status of the streets and alleys cleaning according to the ZIPCODE of different districts in the DC area, then DPW have better idea about which part that we need to perform the investigation first and do the cleaning work according to the different status of the “SERVICEORDERSTATUS” on the dataset. 

#### QUESTION: Document the workflow needs such that I can recreate each of the steps

#### All of the code is well documented, you only need to upload the csv file which I included the csv file in my respority or you can search on the open data website that I provide above and download it. If you can download the csv file and input into the csv reading area of the web, it will give you all the result according to your choice on the variable and method of analysis.
